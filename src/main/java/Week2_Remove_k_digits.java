Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.

Note:
The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.
The given num does not contain any leading zero.
Example 1:

Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
Example 2:

Input: num = "10200", k = 1
Output: "200"
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
Example 3:

Input: num = "10", k = 2
Output: "0"
Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.

        // Approach : Use Stack
        // Check if top of stack contains a number >= than the incoming number
        // If yes, it means, we can pop the top contents of the stack and add this new incoming number since adding this small new incoming number will ensure the number formed in the stack will be smallest
        //         - there is also a chance, even after popping top contents of stack, still the second number in the stack which now becomes the top of stack is again > than incoming number.
        //         - In that case, again pop top of stack. This needs to be done until we have popped(or removed 'k' digits ) or until top of stack < incoming number. Because, when top of stack < incoming number, it means we are continuing to form a smaller number
        // If no, it means the stack already contains smaller number till now, and adding new incoming number will continue to generate a smaller number

                                                    // If we have top of stack >= incoming digit:- See example:1432219. stack will contain 1, 2( 2 is top of stack), another 2 comes, we have to pop the top of stack.
                                                    // Reason: For top of stack >= incoming nmuber => We dont pop out, it will be 1 2 2 and for top of stack > = incoming number => We pop out it will be 1 2. So in this case 1 2 < 1 2 2. 
                                                    // But it would not work for "112", k = 1, we would have 1(top of stack), another 1 comes, top of stack is popped. We would end up getting "12" as the final answer which is wrong.
                                                    // However, it we put top of stack > incoming digit, 1 would be top of stack, we add another incoming 1 and 2. We would get "11" as our final answer which is even smaller than "12" that we got above.
                                                    // That is why the condition will be "top of stack > incoming number"
